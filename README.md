Sibyl
=====

A _Miasm2_ based function divination.

Idea
----

In reverse engineer work, stripped binaries are common (malwares, firmwares, ...). Often, they carry usual libraries, such as _libc_ or _openssl_. Identifying such libraries and their functions can be an interesting starting point.
But it is a time consuming task. Moreover, this task is made more difficult due to optimizations, architectures and compilers diversity, custom implementations, ...

Tools have been developed to automate this task. Some are based on CFG (Control Flow Graph) signature (_Bindiff_), others on magic constants (_FindCrypt_) or enhanced pattern matching (_FLIRT_).

_Sibyl_ is one of these tools, dynamic analysis oriented and **based on _Miasm2_** (http://code.google.com/p/miasm/).
The idea is to identify the side effects of functions. That way, identification is independent of the used implementation.

Identifications are done thanks to these steps:

1. Initialize the state of a _Miasm2_ VM with only needed elements
2. Prepare the function call using the correct ABI and API
3. Run the target function code inside the VM
4. If the function crashes (null derefencement, not enough stack arguments, ...), switch to the next test case
4b. If the function ends correctly, compare the final VM state with the expected one. If they match, consider the test case as a candidate

For instance, if one want to identify a _strlen_, the test will be as follow:

1. Allocate a string containing _"Hello %sworld!"_ in a read-only memory page
2. Call the function with a pointer on the string as first argument
3. Compare the result with _14_
4. Execute the same test with a different string to avoid false positives (detecting a function which always returns _14_)

_Sibyl_ test cases are written **architecture and ABI independant**.

Basically, _Sibyl_ suffers from false positives (identifying a non _strlen_ as a _strlen_ one) and false negatives
(misidentifying or skipping a real _strlen_).
Given the hypothesis that the ABI is exactly the one used by the function, Sibyl becomes complete (no more false negatives).

As a sideline, _Sibyl_ can be used to bruteforce a program ABI.

**Long story short, this is an enhanced API bruteforcing tool**.

Usage
-----

_Sibyl_ comes with several test cases, implementing a part of _string.h_, _stdlib.h_ and _ctype.h_.

Interfaces are **find.py** and corresponding _IDA_ (https://www.hex-rays.com) stub **find_ida.py**.

### Basic
```
$ python find.py -h

positional arguments:
  filename              File to load
  architecture          Architecture used. Available: arml,armb,armtl,armtb,sh
                        4,x86_16,x86_32,x86_64,msp430,mips32b,mips32l
  abi                   ABI to used. Available: ABIStdCall_x86_32,ABIFastCall_
                        x86_32,ABI_AMD64,ABI_ARM,ABI_MIPS_O32
  address               Address of the function under test

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t [TESTS [TESTS ...]], --tests [TESTS [TESTS ...]]
                        Tests to run. Available: all,ctype,string,stdlib

```
An example of included tests (_stderr_ is redirected to null to avoid Miasm2 memory error warnings):

```
$ time python find.py c_tests/test_ctype x86_32 ABIStdCall_x86_32 0x8048e59 2>/dev/null
0x08048e59 : isalpha

real    0m1.311s
user    0m1.849s
sys     0m0.308s
```

### IDA stub

In order to use the _find_ida.py_ script, one needs to edit it to assign _identify_binary_ to the correct path of _find.py_.
Once the script has been loaded by _IDA_, these functions are provided:

* _identify_help()_: print help
* _identify_me(architecture, abi, options)_: candidates for current
function
* _identify_all(architecture, abi, options)_: candidates for all
functions recognized by _IDA_

An example on _busybox-i486_ (busybox 1.21.1 http://www.busybox.net/downloads/binaries/1.21.1/):

```
Python> identify_me("x86_32", "ABIStdCall_x86_32")

```

Tests were run on a standard 4 cores CPU (_Sibyl_ support multiprocessing).

### Adding a test case
Available test cases are in the directory _sibyl/test/_.
A test has to extend the class _sibyl.test.test.Test_ and provide at least:

* _func_: the name of the function to test
* _tests_: a list of (_init_, _check_) methods respectively called to initialize the VM and check the resulting state

Here is a commented case:
```Python
class TestA64l(test.Test):

    my_string = "v/"
    value = 123

    # Test
    def init(self):
        # Alloc a string thanks to a common API, in read only
        self.my_addr = self._alloc_string(self.my_string)
        # Set the first argument independently of ABI
        self._add_arg(0, self.my_addr)

    def check(self):
        # Get the result independently of ABI
        result = self._get_result()
        # Check the expected result, and verify memory
        return all([result == self.value,
                    self._ensure_mem(self.my_addr, self.my_string)])

    # Properties
    func = "a64l"
    tests = [(init, check)]
```

A more elaborated test can be found in _sibyl/test/ctype.py_.

### Emulation engine

A few emulation engine are supported. Through the `--jitter` option, one can
specified:

* `python`: use a full Python emulation
* `tcc` or `gcc`: use a C compiler to JiT code (thanks to Miasm)
* `qemu`: use the Unicorn (http://www.unicorn-engine.org/) QEMU binding

Installation
------------
_Sibyl_ requires the last version of _Miasm2_ and the corresponding version of _Elfesteem_.
For the `qemu` engine, the `unicorn` python package must be installed (refer to the documentation of Unicorn for more detail).
_Sibyl_ comes as a package, without _setup.py_ utility for now.
One just needs to add the _Sibyl_ root directory to its _PYTHONPATH_ environment variable.

_Sibyl_ is also available through _Docker automated build_. Use:

```
$ docker run -i -t commial/sibyl
usage: find.py [-h] [-t [TESTS [TESTS ...]]] [-v] [-q] [-i TIMEOUT]
               [-m MAPPING_BASE] [-j JITTER]
               filename architecture abi address [address ...]

```

Testing
-------

Sibyl is provided with a few regression tests.

To test a Sibyl installation:

```
$ cd c_tests && python run_ctests.py
...
```

One should have at least a few functions detected. Depending on your system, the
package `libc6-dev-i386` may be required to build the tests.

Depending on the current Sibyl state, some functions can be misdetected or
absent.


FAQ
---

### How infinite loops are managed ?

Behaviors close to infinite loop happen quite often, especially when the arguments are not formatted as expected by the function (trying another test case).
To avoid these behaviors, there is a timeout on each sub-test. The _-i/--timeout_ argument adjusts this parameter (2 by default, 0 to disable timeout).

### How to run the tool on a custom architecture ?

Once the architecture and corresponding semantic is implemented in Miasm2, one just needs to implement the wanted ABI in _sibyl/abi/_.
If writing the jitter engine part is an issue, one can directly use the _python_ jitter option with _-j/--jitter_ argument.
